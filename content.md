# Content of my presentation

When two atoms form a chemical bond, they share electrons between themselves.
However, these electons are not uniformly distributed between the two atoms.
Some atoms might have a higher electronegativity than others, and therefore they will attract more electrons.
This uneven distribution of electrons influences the physical properties of the molecule and determines how it interacts with other molecules.
One way of describing this uneven distribution of electron density is by assigning partial atomic charges to individual atoms within the molecule
