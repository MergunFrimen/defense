  % abstract = {{The AlphaFold2 prediction algorithm opened up the possibility of exploring proteins’ structural space at an unprecedented scale. Currently, \\&gt;200 million protein structures predicted by this approach are deposited in AlphaFoldDB, covering entire proteomes of multiple organisms, including humans. Predicted structures are, however, stored without detailed functional annotations describing their chemical behaviour. Partial atomic charges, which map electron distribution over a molecule and provide a clue to its chemical reactivity, are an important example of such data. We introduce the web application αCharges: a tool for the quick calculation of partial atomic charges for protein structures from AlphaFoldDB. The charges are calculated by the recent empirical method SQE+qp, parameterised for this class of molecules using robust quantum mechanics charges (B3LYP/6-31G*/NPA) on PROPKA3 protonated structures. The computed partial atomic charges can be downloaded in common data formats or visualised via the powerful Mol* viewer. The αCharges application is freely available at https://alphacharges.ncbr.muni.cz with no login requirement.}},

  abstract = {{Large biomolecular structures are being determined experimentally on a daily basis using established techniques such as crystallography and electron microscopy. In addition, emerging integrative or hybrid methods (I/HM) are producing structural models of huge macromolecular machines and assemblies, sometimes containing 100s of millions of non-hydrogen atoms. The performance requirements for visualization and analysis tools delivering these data are increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol* Viewer enables 3D visualization and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental data, together with capabilities for displaying structure quality, functional, or biological context annotations. High-performance graphics and data management allows users to simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed) protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party services. Mol* Viewer is open source and freely available at https://molstar.org/.}},

  % abstract = {{Partial atomic charges serve as a simple model for the electrostatic distribution of a molecule that drives its interactions with its surroundings. Since partial atomic charges are frequently used in computational chemistry, chemoinformatics and bioinformatics, many computational approaches for calculating them have been introduced. The most applicable are fast and reasonably accurate empirical charge calculation approaches. Here, we introduce Atomic Charge Calculator II (ACC II), a web application that enables the calculation of partial atomic charges via all the main empirical approaches and for all types of molecules. ACC II implements 17 empirical charge calculation methods, including the highly cited (QEq, EEM), the recently published (EQeq, EQeq+C), and the old but still often used (PEOE). ACC II enables the fast calculation of charges even for large macromolecular structures. The web server also offers charge visualization, courtesy of the powerful LiteMol viewer. The calculation setup of ACC II is very straightforward and enables the quick calculation of high-quality partial charges. The application is available at https://acc2.ncbr.muni.cz.}},
